This is a place where all my solutions to particular programming puzzles live. They're probably mostly written Python, but there might be some in other languages too.

hoppity - Also known as "fizzbuzz", it spits out "Hoppity" if divisible by 3, "Hophop" if divisible by 5, "Hop" if divisible by both, and nothing otherwise. To run: python hoppity testfiles/hop.txt

liarliar - Given a list of names and a number, each name has that many number of names under it. The names listed under each name are those he/she thinks are liars. Do some cross-referencing and generate a list of liars and non-liars. To run: python liarliar testfiles/lies.txt NOTE: this program is still incomplete.

roman - Convert a given number to its Roman numeral representation. To run: python roman [number]


The following puzzles may have a solution or two in their respective folders, but may need some fixing for efficiency and accuracy:
brickwall - Given 2 blocks of different dimensionsand a wall dimension, count the number of ways in which you can build a wall of that dimension such that adjacent rows do not have cracks that line up.

rebus - Description to come.
